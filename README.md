# 100DaysOfMLCode

This would be my edition of 100 Days of ML Code, where I will do my best to make a continuous learning path towards understanding Machine Learning. 
I understand that in no way will I be a perfect ML Engineer in just 100 days, but this will be a start. I will also be contributing the code that I make through this journey for everyone to look. I look forward to commitment and learning lots of new things.
