# 100DaysOfMLCode

This would be my edition of 100 Days of ML Code, where I will do my best to make a continuous learning path towards understanding Machine Learning. 
I understand that in no way will I be a perfect ML Engineer in just 100 days, but this will be a start. I will also be contributing the code that I make through this journey for everyone to look. I look forward to commitment and learning lots of new things.

A little background about me, I'm Askhit Aggarwal, 19. I'm a Freshman at college, MSIT - GGSIPU. My very little background in computer science is all related to C++, I'm yet to explore Python and various other technologies. From what I have heard and encountered till date, Machine Learning and Computer Science are a lot about Logic and Mathematics both of which I enjoy dearly.
